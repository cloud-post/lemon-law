		<p>California's vehicle lemon law is designed to help consumers who have purchased lemons, or vehicles that they could not get adequately repaired under warranty. If the customer can show that the vehicle is a lemon that suffers from a significant manufacturing defect, the manufacturer must either provide a replacement vehicle or a refund.</p>
<p>To file a case under the lemon law, you must first make a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; number of attempts to get the vehicle repaired under its manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty. The statute does not specify the number of trips, but generally speaking, if you have made multiple attempts to repair the same issue without success, you may have a case.</p>
<p>The lemon law in <a href="https://www.californialemonlaw-lawyers.com/the-california-lemon-law/does-the-california-lemon-law-cover-products-other-than-automobiles/">California covers</a> most new cars, trucks, and SUVs that you have purchased for yourself, your family, or your household for use on state roads and highways. It will also cover a used vehicle that you have purchased if it is still under the original manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty. Finally, the lemon law applies to vehicles identified as lemons and repurchased by the manufacturer but were then repaired and resold with a warranty.</p>

<p>While California&rsquo;s vehicle lemon law does not cover motorcycles, they are covered under the state&rsquo;s consumer lemon laws if they are still under warranty. If you have purchased a motorcycle that is covered under the warranty, you may be <strong>eligible for a refund or replacement</strong> if the motorcycle has been determined to be a lemon.</p>
<h2>When is a Vehicle Considered a Lemon?</h2>
<p>California&rsquo;s lemon law specifies that for a vehicle to be considered a lemon, it must have a <a href="https://www.calilemonlawyers.com/what-types-of-problems-are-covered-by-the-lemon-law/">material defect</a> that keeps you from using it as intended, makes it less safe, or reduces its value. That means you can&rsquo;t claim a vehicle is a lemon based on dings, dents, or other minor flaws that don&rsquo;t impact the vehicle&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p><em>You must also give the manufacturer a reasonable opportunity to repair the material defect under the vehicle&rsquo;s warrant</em>y.</p>
<p>Some common defects that will cause a vehicle to qualify as a lemon include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Engine failure or malfunction</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Problems with the electrical system, including the starter</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Transmission problems</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Brake problems</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Defects in the frame or chassis</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Steering problems</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Design defects</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if a vehicle&rsquo;s problems are the result of your actions after a manufacturer delivered it, you cannot make a lemon law claim. For example, if you are involved in an accident and can&rsquo;t get the car properly repaired, you will not have a lemon law claim.</p>

<h2>How Lemon Law Works?</h2>
<p><em>If your vehicle suffers from substantial defects despite your best efforts to repair it under warranty, you may be covered by the lemon law.</em> This law allows you to request a replacement vehicle or a refund from the manufacturer. If the manufacturer refuses to help, you can take them to court to force them to comply with the law. One of the benefits of California&rsquo;s lemon law is that it allows you to recover <a href="https://www.bickellawfirm.com/attorney-fees-and-the-california-lemon-law/">attorney&rsquo;s fees and court costs</a> if you are successful in court, which means you will not need to pay out-of-pocket for an attorney to represent you.</p>
<p>If you're having problems with a lemon, you need a lemon law attorney. Lemon laws are state laws that <strong>provide protections for consumers</strong> who buy defective vehicles. If your car has a serious defect that can't be fixed, you may be entitled to a refund or replacement.</p>
<p><a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">Lemon law attorneys</a> can help you navigate the lemon law process and get the compensation you deserve. They can also help you file a lemon law claim if your car manufacturer is unwilling to work with you.</p>
<p>In the end, Lemon law attorneys are attorneys who represent people needing help with lemon cars, health insurance or other products that weren't what they said they were. Lemon laws vary from state to state. The attorneys help consumers with paperwork, negotiations with the manufacturer, and if necessary, filing a lawsuit. Lemon laws have been in place since the 1930s.</p>
