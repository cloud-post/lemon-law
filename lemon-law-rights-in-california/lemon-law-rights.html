                         <p>The Lemon Law in California is a consumer protection law that applies to vehicles like cars, trucks, vans, SUVs, RVs, motorcycles, and boats. The law is given its nickname because people have come to refer to troublesome vehicles as "lemons."</p>
<p><em>For the most part, the vehicle must be under warranty in order to qualify for protection under the Lemon Law.</em> (However, the law does make exceptions for vehicles that had an ongoing problem that required it to be in the shop several times prior to the <strong>expiration of the warranty</strong>. Please visit our <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">website</a> to see more about california lemon law information.</p>
<br><h2>What Does Qualify As A Lemon Car?</h2><br>
<p>It applies to <strong>purchased or leased new vehicles</strong>. It also pertains to used vehicles that are certified pre - owned and/or still under a manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="lemon-law-rights-12.jpg" alt="lemon-law-rights" /></p><br>
<p><em>New or used vehicles sold or leased with a manufacturer's written warranty that haven't been repaired within a reasonable number of repair attempts.</em></p>
<br><h2>Have You Made Reasonable Attempts At Repair?</h2><br>
<p>The type of defect can affect what "reasonable attempts" means. For example, a brake problem may be considered reasonable with fewer repair attempts than a defect that doesn't affect the <strong>vehicle's safety</strong>. Another way of proving a reasonable number of <a href="https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2022/04/14/how-many-repair-attempts-does-it-take-before-a-vehicle-is-considered-a-lemon/50259/">repair attempts</a> is by looking at the number of days that the vehicle has been in the shop.</p>
<br><h2>Does Your Car Have Substantial Impairments?</h2><br>
<p><em>A "substantial impairment" is a problem which is covered by the warranty that impairs the car's use, value, or safety.</em></p>
<p>Lemon laws are <strong>designed to protect consumers</strong> who purchase defective vehicles. If your car is a lemon, you may be entitled to a refund or replacement vehicle.</p>
<p>The California lemon law is one of the most <strong>consumer-friendly lemon laws</strong> in the country. It applies to new and used vehicles, and provides strong protections for consumers.If you think you may have a lemon, it is important to know your rights.</p>
<br><h2>Getting A Refund Or A Replacement Car</h2><br>
<p>New or used vehicles sold or leased with a manufacturer's written warranty to buy back or replace a vehicle that hasn't been repaired within a reasonable number of repair attempts. If you qualify under the Lemon Law, you are entitled to get your vehicle repurchased or replaced.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s Lemon Law protects you when a new car you buy or lease cannot be repaired. In some cases, you may be entitled to a <a href="https://www.theconsumerlawgroup.com/library/refund-or-replacement-what-do-you-get-under-the-lemon-law.cfm">replacement or a refund</a>.</p>
<br><h2>What Does California&rsquo;s Lemon Law Cover?</h2><br>
<p>The California Lemon Law covers new cars. It covers used cars too if there is still time remaining on the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty. The Lemon Law covers:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Cars, pickup trucks, vans and SUVs. It also covers the chassis, chassis cab, and drivetrain of a motor home. After-market parts such as van conversions are not included.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Dealer-owned vehicles and demonstrators.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Vehicles purchased or leased for personal, family, or household purposes.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Many vehicles that are purchased or leased primarily for business use.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="lemon-law-rights-13.jpg" alt="lemon-law-rights" /></p><br>
<h2>The Lemon Law Does Not Cover:</h2><br>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Vehicles that are not registered under the California Vehicle Code, such as off-road vehicles.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Vehicles that have been abused.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><h2>When Does The Lemon Law Apply?</h2><br>
<p>California&rsquo;s Lemon Law applies when a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; number of repair attempts have been made. This is called the <strong>Lemon Law Presumption</strong>.</p>
<p>The Lemon Law Presumption applies if all the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The problems your car is having are covered under the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The problem first occurred within 18 months of delivery, or within 18,000 miles, whichever came first. (For major defects after this time frame, talk to an attorney.)</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The problem reduces the use, value or safety of the vehicle to you, and the problems were not caused by abuse.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the lemon law gives you the right to get a <strong>refund or a replacement</strong> from a manufacturer (for as long as you own the car) if your new car has a problem that's considered a <a href="https://www.thelemonlawyer.com/examples-of-vehicle-defects">manufacturer defect</a>. It applies to new used vehicles, but not to aftermarket parts. To get the best result, you should hire an experienced lemon law attorney.</p>
