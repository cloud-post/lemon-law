    			<p>If a new car turns out to be really, really lemony, then you&rsquo;ll be eligible for a full or partial refund. The laws in California are, very loosely, called the &ldquo;Lemon Law&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Lemon Aid Law&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s important to know your rights if you suspect you have purchased or leased a car that turns out to be defective. <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California Lemon Law attorneys</a> are worth their weight in gold&mdash;especially if you are dealing with one of the car brands listed below.</p>
<ol>
<h2><strong>1. No fees</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think your car is a lemon, the consultation with a lemon law lawyer is free. They will let you know if <strong>filing a claim to seek compensation</strong> from the manufacturer or retailer of your vehicle makes sense for your particular circumstance and thereby whether it&rsquo;s worth proceeding. What&rsquo;s more, if one does succeed in their claim and is deemed eligible for compensation, California Lemon Laws stipulate that consumers receive a refund of their money and the auto manufacturer/retailer pays all attorneys fees and costs, not them.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Maximizing your settlement</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a person purchases a vehicle from an auto manufacturer or dealership and the automobile has been found to be defective, then it's known as having been defaulted to "lemon law." This is not the same as regular law enforcement for the purpose of making sure people abide by the laws set within their jurisdiction. While state laws vary, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_law">two primary types of lemon law</a> which protect consumers.</p>
<ol>

<h2><strong>3. Cutting through red tape</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people do not understand what they need to do in order to file an insurance claim or even how the claims process works. This can be frustrating and stressful and lead one to getting very confused about what steps to take next. A good insurance claims attorney helps guide the applicant through the <strong>process of filing their claim</strong> so that all deadlines are met and any possible legal repercussions from pursuing a claim are minimized.</p>
<ol>

<h2><strong>4. Getting the right offer</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One way car dealerships make people believe they're getting a &lsquo;great deal&rsquo; is by <strong>offering a low amount of money</strong> on the vehicle they want to trade in. They know that most car owners feel like the price proposed is fair and take it before ever finding out what the real value of their vehicle is worth. Make sure you avoid this lure of low-balling and have your attorney look into all options related to your used car's trade-in value because you'll likely find it differs from what was originally proposed by the salesman at the dealership .</p>
<ol>

<h2><strong>5. Fighting for you to the end</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/auto-news/how-do-i-file-a-lemon-law-claim/">lemon law claim</a> is denied, a lemon lawyer can let you know what options are available to you and help you make an informed decision regarding the best possible solution for your situation.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="lemon-law-attorney-48.jpg" alt="lemon-law-attorney" /></p>
<h2><strong>An Attorney Can Determine Whether You Have a Valid Lemon Law Claim</strong></h2>
<p>An experienced car attorney can help you fight for your rights. For example, if you feel that the car that you have purchased falls under lemon law regulations because of a manufacturing or mechanical defect that makes the product unusable, a good attorney will be able to help you decide whether your case is strong enough for fighting it with an expert in lemon laws.</p>
<p>While it can be difficult and frustrating having to deal with vehicles in need of problems, the issues may not automatically make it a lemon. Laws must be applied and specific criteria must be satisfied in order for a vehicle to qualify as a lemon. An attorney will be able to assess whether the issues with your car are the kind of problem that could make it qualify as a lemon.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>That you purchased the vehicle in the state</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The car was under warranty when the defect was discovered</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The manufacturer was provided with a reasonable opportunity to make repairs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, When hiring a lemon law attorney, you've got a better chance at maximizing your compensation if you hire one who has hunted many lemons before in their endless quest for justice. Be sure that they know the ropes and will make sure you're compensated properly. They need to know what a fair settlement offer is and be able to negotiate accordingly to ensure you get most of your asking price.</p>
