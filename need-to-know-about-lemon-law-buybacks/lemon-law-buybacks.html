<p>If you are in the market for a new car, you should familiarize yourself with lemon law buybacks. Many new car buyers may not be <strong>aware of lemon law buybacks</strong> and the implications they can have on the purchase of a vehicle. Lemon law buybacks are vehicles previously owned by someone who has exercised their rights under the state&rsquo;s lemon law and have been returned to the manufacturer due to a major defect.</p>
<p>It is important for potential car buyers to be aware of these lemon law buybacks as they may not have been adequately fixed before being resold by the manufacturer. By understanding the lemon law buyback process, car buyers can make an informed decision when considering purchasing a vehicle that may have been previously affected by a lemon law claim.
