This can be a complex process, and it's essential to have a thorough understanding of the law to ensure that you receive fair compensation.</p>
<p>If you believe a car you have purchased in California has persistent defects that impair its use, value, or safety, you may be entitled to a refund or replacement vehicle, cash compensation, or buyback from the manufacturer or licensed dealer under the "Lemon Law" of California.</p>
