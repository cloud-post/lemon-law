         California Lemon Law: Everything You Need To Know About Getting A Car Fixed Under Warranty
        </div>
        
      </h1>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve purchased a new car in California and it turns out to be a lemon, you may be covered by the state&rsquo;s lemon law. Here are some key facts about <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California&rsquo;s lemon law</a> that you should know.</p>
<p>The lemon law applies to new cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs that have a defect that substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the vehicle. The defect must be covered by the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty and must occur within the first <strong>18 months or 18,000 miles</strong>, whichever comes first.</p>
<h2>1. California&rsquo;s Lemon Law applies to leased vehicles</h2>
<p><em>One of the biggest advantages of renting instead of buying is that you'll usually get a more reliable, newer model every few years. </em>This makes it much easier for you to avoid breakdowns altogether. Unfortunately, the probability of a vehicle leaving the factory floor with a defect is the same whether the car is <strong>leased or sold</strong> by the dealer. The good news is that the rights of those who lease are no different than the rights of those who purchase new vehicles under California law.</p>

<br><h2>2. Used cars may qualify under the Lemon Law</h2>
<p>California's Lemon Law is only for vehicles included in the original <a href="https://lemonlawexperts.com/why-do-i-need-a-manufacturers-warranty-for-a-lemon-law-case/">manufacturer's warranty</a>. However, coverage remaining on the warranty at the time of the subsequent sale may transfer to the new owner, making it possible to purchase a used (but relatively new) car and still have <strong>Lemon Law rights</strong>. The law does not apply to extended warranties purchased separately by the otherwise-returning owner or a third party.</p>
<h2>3. The Lemon Law covers many kinds of popular vehicles</h2>
<p>Although Californians do not always buy vehicles for travel on our streets and highways, off-road recreational vehicles make up a significant percentage of all automobile sales in Southern California. Boats, too, are very common purchases in <a href="https://www.lemonlaw4california.com/">Orange County</a> and the rest of the Southern California coast. As long as they are sold through a dealer and have a factory warranty, covered vehicles can be included:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Travel and camper trailers</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Boats</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Jet-skis</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Small planes.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Motorcycles</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>ATVs</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Side-by-sides</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These vehicles will be regarded as goods and will be viewed as having some of the policies and <strong>protections for passenger vehicles</strong>.</p>
<h2>4. Vehicles used primarily for business purposes may also qualify</h2>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="lemon-law-0.jpg" alt="lemon-law" /></p>
<br><p>The California Lemon Law is intended to protect customers, but it does not mean that it only <strong>covers consumers</strong>. Businesses that purchase faulty vehicles are likewise protected. It does not matter how a business is run (sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, corporation, etc.) or whether the vehicle is a dual-use vehicle driven by both individuals and companies.</p>
<p>The Lemon Law put two limitations on business vehicles. To qualify for the same protections that private vehicles receive:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The vehicle must not weigh more than 10,000 pounds.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The business should have no more than five vehicles registered in California.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The second requirement describes how the <strong>five-vehicle limit</strong> embodies the lawmakers' intent to extend Lemon Law protections to small businesses in our state. Large businesses operating whole fleets of commercial lorries usually do not believe in the Lemon Law because they possess other means of solving automobile disputes.</p>
<h2>5. California&rsquo;s Lemon Law has a four-year statute of limitations</h2>
<p>A new-car warranty is generally a written contract. Like any other lawsuit for breach of a written contract in California, a <strong>Lemon Law claim</strong> must be filed within four years of the date the contract was breached. As the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit cannot be satisfied without changing manufacturer notifications, publishing a note is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Be aware that the time limit for filing a <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/auto-news/how-do-i-file-a-lemon-law-claim/">warranty claim</a> may extend beyond the warranty period. This is because the Statute of Limitations does not start running at the time of purchase lease. That date is when the warranty contract begins to run. The statute of limitations runs from when the warranty contract has been broken. In other words, the expiration of the warranty period begins to run the moment a <strong>defect covered</strong> by the warranty is discovered and the dealership fails to fix it within the timeframe allotted. This may occur months or years before it expires.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the California lemon law is an important law that helps protect you from having a bad experience with an unwanted vehicle. If you have purchased a car that has been deemed a lemon, you should take pause and consider other options. You may want to consider a lemon law attorney who will help you with your case and make you aware of the facts.</p>
