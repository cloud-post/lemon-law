<p>The Lemon Law Buyback program is a great way for Californians to get rid of their lemons. To qualify for a buyback, the vehicle must have a defect that substantially impairs its use, value, or safety, and the manufacturer must have been given a <strong>reasonable number of attempts</strong> to repair the defect.</p>
<p><em>If the manufacturer is unable to repair the defect after a reasonable number of attempts, they are required to offer the consumer a buyback option. </em>The consumer can either receive a replacement vehicle or a refund of the purchase price, minus a deduction for the use of the vehicle.</p>
<h2>How Does The Lemon Law Buyback Program Work?</h2>

<p>Once you have established that your vehicle qualifies for a buyback, your attorney will send a demand letter to the manufacturer. The demand letter will outline the defect in detail and provide evidence of the manufacturer's attempts to repair the defect. The letter will also request a buyback of the vehicle under the <strong>Lemon Law Buyback program</strong>.</p>
<p>If the manufacturer agrees to the buyback, they will offer you a choice between a <a href="https://www.theconsumerlawgroup.com/library/refund-or-replacement-what-do-you-get-under-the-lemon-law.cfm">replacement</a> vehicle or a refund of the purchase price, minus a deduction for the use of the vehicle. If you choose a replacement vehicle, the manufacturer must provide a vehicle that is substantially identical to the one being replaced. <em>If you choose a refund, the manufacturer must provide the full purchase price of the vehicle, minus the use deduction.</em></p>
