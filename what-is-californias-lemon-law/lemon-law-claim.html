                          <p>Buying a lemon is a frustrating and frightening experience, and no one wants to have to buy a new car again. Whether your car has a mechanical problem or you bought a used car dud, it&rsquo;s good to know you have rights and a solution. California&rsquo;s lemon law can help. The law requires car makers to make good on defects that exist in the vehicle for 24 months or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first. For more info: <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">McMillan Law Group</a></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a buyer beware world, so even if you don&rsquo;t buy a car with the <strong>lemon law protections</strong>, consider taking out an extended service plan that will protect you for a car problem down the road.</p>
<h2>The Lemon Law Basics</h2>
<p>The California <strong>Lemon Law provides protection</strong> for consumer goods that are purchased or leased for personal, family, or household use. The California lemon law applies to most consumer goods, except for clothes and consumable goods, such as fruits, vegetables, cosmetics, and over-the-counter drugs.</p>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="law-attorney-9.jpg" alt="law-attorney" /></p><br>
<p>In California, if a manufacturer cannot repair a consumer good after a reasonable number of <a href="https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/auto-lemon-law/maine/how-many-repair-attempts-must-be-made-before.html">repair attempts</a>, then it must either replace or refund the consumer&rsquo;s money for the defective product.</p>
<p>CA lemon law rules generally cover many types of vehicles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Cars,</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Pickup trucks,</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Vans,</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>SUVs, and</em></li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Motorcycles.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The lemon law in California protects consumers who have purchased or leased new and used vehicles that are under warranty. The <strong>lemon law covers</strong> vehicles that have defects or problems that arise within a certain period of time after the vehicle has been purchased. If you think you may have a lemon, you should contact an experienced <a href="https://www.thelemonlawattorneys.com/">lemon law attorney</a> to find out if you are covered under the lemon law.</p>
<h2>California's lemon law</h2>
<p>California law protects drivers from predatory sales tactics and abuse from car manufacturers and dealerships. There are many aspects to <strong>practicing lemon law</strong>, so you will want a dedicated attorney on your case. <em>We have extensive experience handling cases involving both manufacturers and dealerships.</em></p>
<p>In California, next to a house, a person's most important purchase is often their car. Without a car, a person loses access to their most reliable form of transportation. When you purchase a vehicle, you have a reasonable expectation for your vehicle to be within a certain working order. When you have car trouble, it affects nearly every area of your life.</p>
<p><em>A lack of personal transportation means having to get rides to work, to pick up your kids, or even just to go to the store.</em> On top of this, car repairs are time-consuming, expensive, stressful, and incredibly inconvenient. When you try to negotiate with the dealer about your options, you will likely be met with arguments, frustration, and confusion, when all you want is a working car. When this happens, you may have one remedy for the situation: the law.</p>

<p>A car that's been more in the shop than on the road might be considered a lemon. Under California law you may be entitled to compensation from a dealer, or even manufacturer. When it comes time to <strong>review warranties or conduct repairs </strong>on your car, you'll find that many of the friendly faces have disappeared, and are replaced with contract employees who are just doing their job of helping the dealership earn money rather than uphold its end of the bargain by offering reliable transportation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An attorney can help you look through your warranty rights and make sure they've fulfilled their promises to keep you driving!</em></p>
<p>California's Lemon Law without a knowledgeable <a href="https://www.contractscounsel.com/b/lemon-law-lawyer">legal advocate</a> is as difficult as understanding the law behind it. In many ways, your lawyer is like a map that shows you the quickest and simplest route through the process of disputing an automobile sale in court. As a business invaluable asset and possession, you should have someone guiding your way rather than leaving you to wade through this process alone.</p>
<p>We have two focuses as attorneys: the Lemon Law, and getting our clients the best results we can. We have honed our focus on these particular types of cases to maximize our potential. From Fords to Hondas to Maseratis, we are unafraid to challenge both dealers and manufacturers for <strong>fair and proper compensation</strong>.</p>
<p>In summary, in general, lemon law has been useful in protecting consumers against manufacturers' mistakes. However, the general public is not aware of lemon law. In order to clarify the <strong>awareness of lemon law</strong>, the Bureau of Consumer Affairs will take into consideration especially young consumers.</p>
