<p>According to the California Lemon Law, you can buy a <strong>used car that was covered</strong> under the manufacturer's warranty or that was given a dealer warranty, but you have to be mindful of your personal automobile purchase.</p>
<h2>Implied Car Warranties:</h2>
<p><em>Unless the dealer sold you a car as-is, your car is covered by an implied warranty of merchantability, regardless of whether it has an unsigned warranty.</em></p>
<p>The implied warranty of merchantability is an <strong>unwritten guarantee</strong> from the manufacturer that the vehicle will fulfill its function. If there has been a significant flaw in your used vehicle, and you think it existed until you purchased it, the seller might have acted in violation of the warranty.</p>
