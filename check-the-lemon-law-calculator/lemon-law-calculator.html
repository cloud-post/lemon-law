<h3>Vehicle Replacement</h3>
<p><em>Your dealership will provide another vehicle that is similar in value and options. Your new vehicle will come with the same dealer options as your first.</em> In some instances, the dealer will offer you the same service contract. You may be entitled to some form of <strong>reimbursement</strong> if the car was towed or you rented another vehicle while yours was being repaired after an accident.</p>

<br><h2>What Is A Cash-And-Keep Lemon Law Settlement?</h2><br>
<p>If your Consumer Protection Act complaint for your damaged automobile does not satisfy your state 's requirements, then your retailer might be required to pay you monetary compensation and keep your vehicle in a cash-and-keep settlement. A <strong>cash-and-keep investigation</strong> means that you could get to keep your automobile, but you'll receive cash for the problems you've faced as a result of this damaged vehicle. <em>It may be to your interest to speak with an attorney about the usefulness and issue of the cash and receipt plan.</em></p>
