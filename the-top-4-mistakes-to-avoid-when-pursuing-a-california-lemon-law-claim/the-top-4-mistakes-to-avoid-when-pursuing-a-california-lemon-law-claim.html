         The Top 4 Mistakes To Avoid When Pursuing A California Lemon Law Claim
        </div>
        
      </h1>
<p>The vast majority of consumers experiencing a lemon are doing so for the first time. We talked about several common rip-offs we see when consumers start the <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California lemon law</a> process. Now we want to discuss some seemingly small, lesser-known mistakes that can potentially doom your claim altogether.</p>
<h2>1. Being Rude to Repair or Manufacturer Staff</h2>
<p>Lashing out at a staff member is not going to do you any favors. We understand that you're upset after spending a lot of money on a defective vehicle, especially if it's new. It's easy to get emotional about the situation, but try to stay calm. Yelling at the staff will not solve the problem.</p>
<p>In any civil legal action &ndash; in which some sort of <strong>compensation </strong>is involved &ndash; there are three major factors that influence your ability to prevail:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="lemon-law.jpg" alt="lemon-law" /></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Facts/evidence</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The law</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Your likeability</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If your case ends up going before a jury of your peers, number three can be the most important. In a perfect world, only the facts and the law should matter. But this is simply a reality of our judicial system &ndash; that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>The goal in court is to convince the jury to order the company to buy back your defective vehicle. If you come across as rude or angry, jurors may see you as unreasonable.<em> The manufacturers are aware of this dynamic and will use it to their advantage in court.</em></p>
<p>It is important to remain calm, no matter how frustrating the repairs may be. Losing your cool will only hurt your chances, even if you have a right to be angry.</p>
<h2>2. Being too specific in your complaint.</h2>
<p>The early stages of a lemon law claim are crucial, but especially when approaching the manufacturer. You might be tempted to get very specific in your complaint - especially if you're knowledgeable about cars. However, it's important to avoid disconnects between the complaint and repair attempts. According to California lemon law, two unsuccessful repair attempts on the same part of the vehicle will likely <a href="https://bclawoffices.com/importance-of-repair-records-for-lemon-law-claims/">legitimize your claim</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, if you tell them it&rsquo;s a problem with the engine the first time, then an issue with the transmission the second time, that could be argued as two separate issues &ndash; which can potentially extend the lemon law process. This is why you always want to describe the symptoms you are experiencing and never what you think is the root cause of the defect.</p>
<p>Your role here is simply to describe the symptoms, not diagnose. Remember, when you go to the doctor you explain your symptoms and the doctor provides the diagnosis. The same is true with auto problems.</p>

<h2>3. Waiting too long to file your claim</h2>
<p>To echo a previous section in this piece, timeliness is critical to a lemon law claim. In California, the statute of limitations to file a lemon law claim is<strong> four years</strong>. The clock can start ticking on this lemon law time limit as soon as you report that you&rsquo;re experiencing a substantial <a href="https://nealefhima.com/types-problems-covered-lemon-law/">defect covered</a> under the manufacturer or dealer warranty.</p>
<p>Not only is driving a defective vehicle dangerous for yourself and other drivers, you will most likely be barred from pursuing your claim after the four years have passed.</p>
<h2>4. Bringing your vehicle to a mechanic that&rsquo;s not certified by the manufacturer.</h2>
<p>If your new or used vehicle is making a weird sound, going to your trusted family mechanic may seem like the logical next step. This is a huge fatal mistake that many unsuspecting consumers make.</p>
<p>Taking the vehicle to a non-manufacturer-certified repair facility can (and likely will) void your warranty &ndash; and subsequently, your lemon law claim. As a result, you&rsquo;ll get stuck with the repair costs and the lemon.</p>
<p>In summary, lemon laws are designed to compensate those injured by defective products. The "lemon law" is a state statute that creates a warranty on behalf of consumers. The <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=9f469618-cb9d-403c-a69d-bc1110842af0">warranty protects</a> those who purchase a new vehicle, who typically have limited time and mileage to return the vehicle to the seller. The warranty provides consumers with a right to reject a lemon vehicle, and obtain a refund or replacement.</p>
