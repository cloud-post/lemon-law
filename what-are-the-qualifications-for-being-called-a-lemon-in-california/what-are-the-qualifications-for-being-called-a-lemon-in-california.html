    			<p>The lemon law may protect you if you purchased a faulty car. The lemon law provides that after a reasonable number of repair attempts, the purchase can be canceled and an alternative vehicle provided.</p>
<p>The lemon law website has all you need when looking for information on state lemon laws, federal warranty laws, automotive complaints and car buying issues.</p>
<h2>What Is the California Lemon Law?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California lemon law</a> is a statute that provides remedies to customers' who experience problems within their vehicle that they have bought. Each state's laws are slightly different, providing varying options like repurchasing the car, or compensation if it so happens that the issue has deducted value from your vehicle.</p>
<h2>What Qualifies as a Lemon?</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="lemon-law-11.jpg" alt="lemon-law" /></p>
<p>A lemon is defined as a vehicle with a continuous impairment to the use, value and safety. A vehicle must:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Have a defect that is covered by the manufacturer's warranty.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Have the defect occur within a specified period of time or a specified number of miles as prescribed by your state.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Still not be fixed after reasonable, repetitive repair efforts.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Are Used Cars Covered Under Lemon Law?</h2>
<p>Most state lemon laws cover new cars. However, if your used car is still covered under the manufacturer's warranty and you have been back to the shop for repetitive repairs, you may still have rights under the<strong> Federal 'Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act'.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Representation under this act is free of charge. You could be looking at <a href="https://www.mass.gov/how-to/get-compensation-for-a-used-car-through-the-lemon-law">monetary compensation</a> to reflect the negative effect on the car' value, in addition to allowing you to keep your warranty intact by not having your car branded in any way. Here are some steps that you can take to get a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<h2>Lemon Laws &mdash; Giving You the Protection You Need</h2>
<p>When you buy a car from a dealer, you expect things to function like they are supposed to. Motor vehicles come with manufacturer warranties - if the vehicle is back in the shop for repairs or is out of commission for an<strong> extended period of time,</strong> talk to a lawyer about working toward getting back on the road again.</p>
<p>If your vehicle has not been in your possession for one year or is less than 10 years old, you may be entitled to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_law">limited warranty</a>. If you believe your Alpha Simulator is defective, please contact us immediately at the following address:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Check engine lights</li>
<li aria-level="1">Water Leaks</li>
<li aria-level="1">Transmission shuddering or jerking</li>
<li aria-level="1">Electrical issues</li>
<li aria-level="1">Paint defects</li>
<li aria-level="1">Airbag lights</li>
<li aria-level="1">Stalling or loss of power</li>
<li aria-level="1">Problems shifting into gear</li>
<li aria-level="1">Error messages</li>
<li aria-level="1">Bluetooth and Radio issues</li>
<li aria-level="1">Sunroof problems</li>
</ul>

<p>We will take care of getting you a full refund back to the condition you purchased our item in and including any taxes, tags, and finance charges that were originally on the vehicle when we sold it to you. We understand that some dealers tack on<strong> various fees at the time</strong> of purchase which might be unfair especially if they are hidden behind it having been added to the original price.</p>
<h2>If You're Driving a Lemon Car, Our Lemon Law Attorneys Are Here to Help</h2>
<p>There is no legal cost to you ever. The manufacturer (warrantor) is responsible for all legal costs, compensation and recovery if we prevail. If we do not prevail, you owe us nothing. There is no cost and no risk. Most claims are resolved in a timely manner, and some within a matter of weeks or months.</p>
<p>If a merchant cannot or will not provide you with a refund or exchange for a product you purchased, there is another option. You can file an arbitration claim. This <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/10/know-your-consumer-protection-laws.asp">consumer protection law</a> applies to all consumer products and is the mechanism for those who have been refused a refund or exchange for defective merchandise under the Lemon Law or its local state counterparts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, When you are driving a lemon, make sure your driver's license is up to date and that you have someone (or multiple people) on your team who can help get you out of the situation and find a way to recoup damages from the car manufacturer should the need arise.</p>
