      <h2><center>What The California Lemon Law Can Do For You If Your Vehicle Is Faulty</center></h2><br>
      <p>Buying a new car is one of the greatest experiences. When you drive away from a dealership in a shiny, new vehicle, you take great pride in your purchase. You show it off to friends and family, you take extra-long routes to your destination just to enjoy the ride, and you know that the vehicle is going to be reliable &ndash; after all, you just paid a hefty sum for a brand-new car.</p>
<p>The California Lemon Law is a state law that aims to protect consumers from defective cars. Passed in 1984, the law allows car buyers to return a defective vehicle within the first 18 months of ownership. The law also requires manufacturers to repair or replace defective vehicles, and to provide reimbursement for related expenses. The <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California Lemon Law</a> is essential for consumer protection, and helps ensure that drivers can get their money's worth when they purchase a car.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Lemon Law helps consumers file claims for damages as a result of defective products. The Lemon Law was created to allow consumers with defective products to direct their frustrations to one place. By allowing consumers to re-route their frustrations to the manufacturer or distributor, this act relieves the consumers of the stress of dealing with multiple companies. The Lemon Law also strengthens the consumer&rsquo;s bargaining position, because manufacturers and distributors know that consumers will still buy their products despite defects. If the consumer can prove that the defect substantially affects the vehicle&rsquo;s performance, it&rsquo;s considered a lemon.</p>
