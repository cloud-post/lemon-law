      </h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, the lemon law is in effect to protect vehicle buyers and leasers who unknowingly bought a defective car. Defects often show up after driving for just one day or about 15 miles. The California Lemon Law helps repair these defects at no cost to you if they are deemed as major by an arbitrator appointed under this act. For minor issues, it can be difficult because some of them do not come under the acts protection while others may fall into its jurisdiction depending on their severity.</span></p>
<h2>How Do You Define a Defect in California Lemon Law?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, you can prove if your vehicle is a lemon or not by showing that there are material defects in the car.

<p><strong>Defect of Use: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The vehicle is not designed to be driven the way you are driving it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Defect of Value:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "You can't sell the vehicle for what it's worth if there are no flaws."</span></p>
<p><strong>Defect of Safety:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You cannot use the vehicle on roads if it affects your and others safety.</span></p>

<h3>Negligence of the Owner of the Vehicle</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lemon law is designed to protect you from unknowingly making a purchase of an expensive vehicle with hidden defects.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your vehicle is under the lemon law, but it's been damaged by an accident before you've bought or leased it, then that won't be protected.</span></p>
