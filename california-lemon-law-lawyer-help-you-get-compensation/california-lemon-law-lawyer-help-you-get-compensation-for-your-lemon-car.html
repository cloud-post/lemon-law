    			<p>You shouldn't have to worry about your car breaking down if you've purchased or leased a new one. Unfortunately, many consumers who have done either end up making multiple trips to the dealership for repairs. If this is you, it's essential to understand your rights under <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California's lemon law lawyers</a>.</p>
<p>The lemon law exists to protect consumers in California who have bought or leased a new or used car, truck, motorcycle, or other vehicle from a dealership. This law requires manufacturers to provide a refund or replacement to consumers if their vehicle has serious defects that still exist after multiple repair attempts.</p>
<h2>Who is Covered Under the Lemon Laws in California?</h2>
<p>The lemon laws in California do not protect every person who owns or leases a vehicle. You must meet certain conditions to qualify for lemon law protection in California. For example, you must have purchased or leased a new or used car, truck, motorcycle, or other vehicle from a dealership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the vehicle must be covered by the manufacturer or dealer warranty. Also, the vehicle must have a defect that substantially impairs its value, use, or safety. If the dealer is unable to fix this defect after multiple <a href="https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/auto-lemon-law/maine/how-many-repair-attempts-must-be-made-before.html">repair attempts</a>, the vehicle is most likely a lemon.</p>
<p>If you meet all of these conditions, you could have the right to file a lemon law claim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers who do not meet these conditions should not give up hope. Even if you are not covered by California&rsquo;s lemon law, you could still be entitled to <strong>compensation</strong> for your defective vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Are You Entitled to Compensation For Your Lemon?</h2>
<p><em>California law stipulates that consumers who meet specific conditions are legally entitled to either a refund or a replacement vehicle</em>. If the refund option is chosen, the manufacturer must refund the purchase price, sales tax, down payments, monthly payments, and any other fees associated with the purchase or lease of the vehicle. If the replacement vehicle option is chosen, the <a href="https://www.theconsumerlawgroup.com/library/refund-or-replacement-what-do-you-get-under-the-lemon-law.cfm">replacement vehicle</a> must be a new, defect-free vehicle that is substantially similar to the one currently owned.</p>
<p><em>If your vehicle is not covered under the state&rsquo;s lemon laws, you could still be entitled to compensation for your vehicle&rsquo;s issues.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Many consumers <a href="http://www.lemonlawcase.com/lemon-law-practice-overview/lemon-law-claim-process/">find the process</a> of filing a lemon law claim to be frustrating and difficult to navigate. Oftentimes, they are unaware of what steps need to be taken or what documentation is necessary to support their claim. Furthermore, manufacturers and dealers can be uncooperative, making it hard for consumers to obtain the refund or replacement they are entitled to. Therefore, it is advisable to hire an attorney who can assist you with filing a claim.</p>
<p>Many people purchase or lease a new or used vehicle with the expectation of a fresh start. The car has low mileage, no wear and tear, and comes with a warranty. However, some of these consumers quickly become frustrated when a problem arises that requires them to repeatedly bring the vehicle in for repairs. Their frustration only continues to grow when the problem still exists after <strong>multiple repair attempts</strong>. If you&rsquo;re in this situation, it&rsquo;s important to file a lemon law claim to obtain a refund or replacement vehicle. Below is a brief overview of how to file a lemon law claim.</p>

<p>In summary, Lemon law means if your auto dealer sold you a vehicle that failed its safety or emissions tests, or came with <strong>undisclosed problems</strong>, you have a right to a refund or a replacement. Many lemon law cases settle without going to court. The law requires dealers to provide a good-faith effort to repair the defective vehicle. If a dealer refuses to fix your vehicle, or fix a vehicle after many attempts, you can sue the dealer for compensation.</p>
