<p>A Lemon Law buyback occurs when a <strong>manufacturer repurchases</strong> a defective vehicle from the consumer. This buyback is typically the result of multiple failed attempts to repair the vehicle under warranty. Once the manufacturer repurchases the vehicle, it is considered a "lemon law buyback" and is required by law to have a specific title designation.</p>
<br><h2>How Does California Lemon Law Protect Consumers?</h2>
<p>The <strong>California Lemon Law</strong> provides protection to consumers who purchase or lease new or used vehicles that turn out to be lemons. The law requires manufacturers to repurchase or replace a defective vehicle if certain criteria are met. These criteria include:</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The defect substantially impairs the vehicle's safety, value, or use</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If these criteria are met, the consumer is entitled to a refund or replacement vehicle. The amount of the refund is typically the purchase price minus any deductions for use. Additionally, the manufacturer may be required to pay the consumer's <a href="https://www.theconsumerlawgroup.com/faqs/legal-fees-are-paid-by-the-manufacturer-in-a-lemon-law-case.cfm">attorney fees and costs</a>.</p>
