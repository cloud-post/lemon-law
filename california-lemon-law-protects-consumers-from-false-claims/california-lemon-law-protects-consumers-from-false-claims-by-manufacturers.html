                          <p>Lemon laws exist to protect those who buy goods for household use. In particular, the California Lemon Law protects consumers who purchase motor vehicles for personal, family or household use. These laws ensure that auto manufacturers abide by their guarantees made in their warranties. One guarantee is that their vehicles provide safe, reliable transportation.</p>
<h2>California Lemon Law Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://mcmillanlawgroup.com/">California lemon law</a> covers defects with your vehicle during the majority of its warranty period. If a problem occurs on account of a defect, the auto manufacturer is expected to resolve the situation. However, auto manufacturers sell thousands and thousands of defective vehicles every year and rarely fix these issues within the time limits imposed by law.</p>

<p>CA lemon law rules generally cover many types of vehicles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Cars,</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Pickup trucks,</em></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>SUVs, and</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Motorcycles.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The lemon law also covers the chassis, chassis cab, and drivetrain of a motor home. The lemon law covers leased vehicles, pre-owned vehicles, and financed vehicles. The lemon car law in California covers both <strong>new and used vehicles</strong> under warranty.</p>
<h2>The Lemon Law Process</h2>
<p>The State of California Lemon Law protects motor vehicles that were bought or leased from licensed dealerships and dealers within the state of California and were purchased with a written warranty from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>After a lemon law attorney takes on your case against the manufacturer, you may be <a href="https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/lemon-laws-what-qualifies-as-a-lemon-52744">eligible</a> for the following rewards under the California Lemon Law:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A cash settlement.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>A replacement vehicle:</strong> A warrantied vehicle that is substantially similar to your old vehicle, with sales taxes and fees paid.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Lemon Law Buyback:</strong> <em>A full refund of your vehicle and related expenses, minus a mileage-based deduction.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lemon Law Exceptions</h2>
<p>Standard Motor Vehicles Act or the California Lemon Law generally does not apply to vehicles used primarily for business, or those who have purchased their vehicle out of state. There are several exceptions however!</p>
<p>The lemon law law in <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2015/04/lemon-laws-a-beginners-guide/">California allows</a> some small businesses to sue manufacturers for defective vehicles. A business must have fewer than 5 registered vehicles, with a combined <strong>weight exceeding 10,000 pounds.</strong></p>
